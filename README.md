### Website Design
Began implementing html and css of the home page. In addition to this, the heat map page to display pollution and energy use of cities has also started to be developed.

### Database
A google MySQL database for the project has been established with associated storage. The database has filled tables for data about electricity prices, power plant emissions, and air pollutants across the United States. Sources for this can be found in the project's wiki.
